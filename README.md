# Text-Image-Classification-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks
Given, a handwritten dataset. This project uses the dataset to create a model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) which is used to predict letters based on the handwriting.

*Python libraries used:*
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib 
4. Tensorflow/Keras

*Steps involved:*
1. Loading and understanding the dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis for finding missing values, selection of features and target attribute, and visualization of the dataset.
3. Splitting the dataset for training and testing.
4. Creating and training the model using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
5. Evaluating the model using the test data.
6. Understanding the working of the model.
